Regression Models to Assess Gender Pay Disparity

Overview

This project aims to stimulate positive socioeconomic and sociocultural change by identifying solutions that can help separate the factors influencing pay variance and reveal the primary sources of differences among men and women workers. It utilizes historical salary data to examine the interplay between gender, education, and age on median salaries. 
A regression model was developed to identify strong indicators of salary. A second regression model was developed to predict when gender pay disparity will be resolved if current legislation and organizational hiring and compensation practices remain unchanged. 
The regression models utilize averages of critical variables, such as gender, age, and education, to forecast the time scale for achieving pay parity using past trend data.

Data

Analysis

Exploratory data analysis is performed to examine the correlation between gender, education, age, and salary.

Results

The results of this analysis and prediction are presented in visualizations and summary statistics.
